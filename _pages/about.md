Hi, Stranger! I’m Zhongyuan (you can also call me Jowan or ZY), an incoming Assistant Professor at Hitotsubashi University. I successfully defended his PhD in Management at the City University of Hong Kong in January 2026. My research sits at the intersection of organization theory, entrepreneurship and strategy, with a particular focus on the concept of authenticity. Empirically, my work centres on the arts and cultural industries, including film, painting, and other cultural fields.
